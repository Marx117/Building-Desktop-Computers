                <p>Here are some pictures of parts from Petre's computer...</p>

            <p>Here is what's called a Motherboard. Basically, its a component that helps connect every other component to each other to make up the computer.</p>
            <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="IMG_1027.JPG" alt="Placeholder">
            <p>This candy bar like component is called a RAM stick. There are two types of memory in a computer: Permanent and Temporary. The RAM stick is a Temporary memory component and is usually grouped in two or four.</p>
            <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="IMG_1028.JPG" alt="Placeholder">
            <p>This is my own Desktop computer! I've named it Cerberus, because it has three light sources. Doesn't it look great?!</p>
            <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="IMG_1029.JPG" alt="Placeholder">
            <p>Here's the inside of my Computer! Here we see all of the parts working in unison to help make videos, play games and communicate with the internet. It's also expandable too! I can put more parts to facilitate other activites like connecting a musical instrument electronically.</p>
            <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="IMG_1033.JPG" alt="Placeholder">
            <p>My Computer Desk! As you can see, there are plenty of peripherals where I use every day to communicate on the web, produce work, and have fun! </p>

                <h3>What are these computer parts?</h3>
                <p>There are many parts that make up a desktop computer. And they all contribute to a greater whole. However, each part individually is only good for one function. Think of it as the different lobes of the brain...</p>
                
                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="BrainLobes.png" alt="Placeholder">
                
                </div>
        </div>
                
        <div class="row justify-content-center mb-5">
            <div class="col-12 col-md-10">
                
                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="ComponentLayout.png" alt="Placeholder">

                
                <p>For instance, the Occipital lobe could be equated to the Graphics Card or GPU. Both serve as a part that is in charge of vision. For memory, the Hard Drive and RAM sticks both serve as long term and short term memory that the Temporal Lobe is in charge of. Peripherals such as CD Drives act as mediums in which information is store, much like books when we read and get information from something.</p>
